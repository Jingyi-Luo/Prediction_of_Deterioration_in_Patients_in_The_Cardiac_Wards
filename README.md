# Prediction_of_Patients_Deterioration_in_The_Cardiac_Wards

This project focuses on detecting deterioration of acutely ill patients in the cardiac ward at the University of Virginia Health System. Patients in the cardiac ward are expected to recover from a variety of cardiovascular procedures, but roughly 5% of patients deteriorate and have to be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for elevated care. This is an important problem because the probability of mortality increases by hour for the patients that are delayed to get into the ICU. In this work, a super learner was built to further the study by stacking logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models. Furthermore, a denoising auto-encoder was created to generate computer-derived features, the results of which were fed to machine learning models mentioned previously to predict patient deterioration.
